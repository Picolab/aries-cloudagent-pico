Aries Cloud Agent - Pico

## How to get your own ACA-Pico agents

1. Own and operate a [node pico-engine](https://github.com/Picolab/pico-engine/tree/master/packages/pico-engine)
1. Create a pico with a name suitable for a connection label
1. Install into that pico the rulesets from the NEXT folder to make it an ACA-Pico

You can repeat steps 2 and 3 for each ACA-Pico agent you want

The recommended way to install the rulesets is to use the semi-automated installer (instructions [here](https://github.com/Picolab/aries-cloudagent-pico/tree/master/NEXT#semi-automating-ruleset-installation))

You can have as many node pico-engine instances running as you care to support
