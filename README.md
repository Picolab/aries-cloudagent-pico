Aries Cloud Agent - Pico

## How to get your own ACA-pico

1. Own and operate a [node pico-engine](https://github.com/Picolab/pico-engine/tree/master/packages/pico-engine)
1. Register the KRL rulesets in this repo with your pico-engine
1. Create a pico with a name suitable for a connection label
1. Install into that pico the ruleset `org.sovrin.aca` to make it an ACA-pico
1. Select protocols you wish it to use and install the corresponding rulesets into the pico

You can repeat steps 3-5 for each ACA-pico agent you want

You can have as many node pico-engine instances running as you care to support
